# Main Page Sacred Portraits

This document provides guidelines for the sacred portrait images used on the main index page of the site.

## Required Images

1. **main-portrait.jpg**
   - A primary editorial-style portrait in a sacred setting
   - Recommended: you in ceremony, holding space, in nature, or behind a veil
   - This is the main image displayed in the "This Is Not Coaching" section
   - Suggested dimensions: 900×1200px (3:4 ratio)

2. **secondary-portrait.jpg**
   - A smaller, complementary portrait image
   - More intimate, possibly a closer view of your face or hands
   - This appears as a small inset photo with the main portrait
   - Suggested dimensions: 400×400px (1:1 ratio)

## Image Guidelines

- Use professional, high-quality images with soft, ambient lighting
- Sacred settings help establish authority and spiritual presence
- Consider candle-lit settings, soft focus, or ceremonial contexts
- Images should align with your brand's aesthetic (amber/gold/earthy tones)
- The portraits should create emotional resonance and trust

These images will appear in the "This Is Not Coaching" section between the BookingMenu and StartHereGuide components, creating visual evidence of your embodied presence and authority.
